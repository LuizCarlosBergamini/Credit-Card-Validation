# Finding-if-creditcard-is-valid
This Python code validates a credit card number using the Luhn algorithm. It prompts the user to input a number, checks its validity, and determines the card type (AMEX, MASTERCARD, or VISA) based on the first two digits. If the card is valid, it displays the card type; otherwise, it prints "INVALID".
